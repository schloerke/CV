  \begin{itemize}
    \item Created a time management tool using gantt charts to help management quickly display employee availability
    \item Created a web-based tutorial consisting of examples of the most common graphics produced when using different layouts by ``white-box''ing complex visualizations into reusable plotting layers
    \item Worked cohesively with the top 15 statisticians within Novartis

% Modeling and Simulation group, Novartis AG. Basel, Switzerland. Invited by Anthony Rossini. Summer 2008. Development of graphical methods, tutorials for visualizing data, and a time management tool.
%
% The web-based tutorial consisted of examples of most common graphics produced when using different layouts. It included new ways to display data as well. The time management tool produced outputs of the projects that people were involved in as reported in a .CSV file (exported .XLS file). The tool used an API to execute everything. It could allow the outputs to be split by project or similar criteria.

% During the internship, I worked coherently with the top 15 statisticians within Novartis.  Each week we meet to learn about what each other was doing.
