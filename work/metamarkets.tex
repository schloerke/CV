% Metamarkets is a web-based platform that allows its clients, digital publishers from around the globe, to gain better understanding of trends in the billions of ads they sell daily. Metamarkets was created to provide large-scale data analytics services. The analytics range from an hourly and daily aggregation of basic information, to predictions of how many advertisement impressions should be sold. By grouping this service in one location, many companies can interface with Metamarkets without trying to produce a similar monolithic service from scratch.
% At Metamarkets, I design the client facing servers to route secure data and a platform for the web browser for client-side interaction. Clients request their data and it is massaged into a small and usable state so the browser is able to view the data easily. Metamarkets’ servers power the data manipulation so that the client only needs a web browser. Once the web browser has a handle on the functional data, I use the latest web graphics, D3, to produce interactive visualizations. D3 (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library created to manipulate website documents based on data. Using D3, I help build our own internal tool called DVL (Dynamic Visualization Library). DVL allows the frontend team to think in terms of pipelines rather than constantly knowing every component’s state. This allows each step of the interaction process to be independent from one another, providing simpler code and smoother interactions. Using a medium that can leverage the latest technology facilitates a symbiotic relationship between the user and company.
