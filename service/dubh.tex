  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hip Hop Club (Dub H): Created an optimal sorting algorithm to place dancers into dances sans politics. Reduced semesterly data entry of 400+ records from 10 hours to 1 hour by allowing concurrent website inputs. Maintained current and historical semester attendance, waiver, and roster information for administrative purposes.
    \item Greek Week: Created an internet-based check-in system tied to university ID cards (2000+ members). Increased maximum check-in rate from one person every twenty seconds to one person every two seconds. Anonimity was maintained to prevent participation bullying within fraternities and sororities.
