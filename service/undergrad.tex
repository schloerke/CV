% Dub H is one of the largest Iowa State University campus organizations with over 450 members. In Dub H, I have been on the executive committee as the Technology Director since Spring semester of 2008. In the Fall of 2007, I helped make the club self-sustaining in that the club now owns its own camera, camera accessories, and editing software and equipment. As technology updates, I recommend software and hardware updates that deem necessary or beneficial. In the Fall of 2009, I updated the website and currently maintain it. The \href{http://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/dubh/}{website} now offers a google calendar and RSS feed to keep the members up-to-date. It also displays our public performances hosted by YouTube. The club performs in front of over 3000+ people within the course of a year. Being on the exec (of six people) board, we prepare for the multiple events and make certain they run smoothly.

% Great Relationships In Pairs is a mentor program within Ames Youth and Shelter Services. I have met with the same Gilbert Middle School student for the past two and a half years. Each week we get together and I provide guidance on how to solve daily social problems as well as a fun hour for his week. It has been rewarding for both of us.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Managed a system with more than 2300 records for 10+ events
    \item Linked to participants Iowa State University identification card
  \end{itemize}
}
% During Greek Week, over 2300 people need to check-in to 10+ events. Using the participants' ISU ID card, they can swipe their card to sign in. This process was manually done by three people and now it can be done with one person manning a computer. The program checks for the person in the database, whether or not they have filled out a waiver, and the participation given by each pairing. Security is used to make sure that the system cannot be altered. I created this program after gaining knowledge from a previous class project.

% Grades have always been important to me. After being appointed scholarship chair in the fall of 2007, I implemented over five new programs to strengthen the house's individual and group GPA. In the evenings, I was available to others in assisting them with their studies. My last semester term, I proposed that FarmHouse make this duty an executive position. The ISU chapter of FarmHouse voted to accept the position of Scholarship Chair to be on the executive committee. Subsequently, as a house we reached a new all time high GPA of  3.29.

While assisting in the planning of the overall event, my main job was to be in charge of food selection and quantity on a \$7000 budget.
