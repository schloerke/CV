  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``\pkg{GGally} extends \pkg{ggplot2} by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data. Some of these functions include a pairwise plot matrix, a two group pairwise plot matrix, a parallel coordinates plot, a survival plot, and several functions to plot networks.''
    \item Maintained R package with 25k+ monthly downloads
    \item Collaborated with 10 major authors and many contributors
    \item Created multiple plot matrix functions to aid in full data exploration
    \item Integrated development with \pkg{lintr} and \pkg{testthat} for code and output consistency
  \end{itemize}
