  %
  % Our group project was to perform exploratory analysis on the housing crisis.  I found, cleaned, and explored multiple data sets.  The R programming language was used to clean the data.  To stay up-to-date with the other group members, Git, a repository language that evolved from SVN, was used constantly throughout the program.  One big requirement, which was followed during the project, was reproducibility.  Anyone could start  by retrieving our code and reproduce everything that we have already produced by sourcing the files we have made.

  %
  % Displaying the airport delays caused by airport layout used multiple applications.  Using Google's KML language, R and wget, Chris and I were able to produce Google Earth Images with the runways highlighted.  Following this, we produced images of the wind tendencies at each airport and matched them up with the corresponding airport runway direction.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Created a custom cartogram of the United States with area proportional to the electoral vote of each state.
      \item Produced the `Electoral Vote Towers' (inspired by New York Times 2000 Presidential Race) that quickly portrayed the electoral vote status.
    \end{itemize}
  }

  % This project focused on the electoral votes of each state. A cartogram of the United States with the area proportional to the electoral vote of each state and the `Electoral Vote Towers' were the two main graphics that I helped develop.
  %
  % The cartogram shows voting pattern in a way that is more representative of the electoral votes while maintaining some geographic relations. The cartogram is block-constructed, coded, and imported into R. It demonstrates the states' area in proportion to its electoral votes. For example, Montana only has an area of three votes, while Rhode Island has an area of four votes even though it is much smaller geographically.  (Votes are determined by the number of representatives within the House and Senate, not by geographic area).
  %
  % The `Electoral Vote Towers' was inspired by a New York Times display during the 2000 presidential election titled ?Building an Election Victory?. These displays show the sum of the electoral votes for each candidate. The shape comes from each state's percent difference (horizontal) and electoral votes (vertical). While the colors may be redundant, it still helps categorize the states' voting percentages. The goal of the candidates is to reach the 270 votes needed to win the presidency which corresponds to the towers building up to the 270th line. Each of the states that are still a toss-up have their relevant statistics reported on the candidate's side to which they are currently leaning.

      \item Extension of the polytope ranking.
      \item Created combinations of DNA sequences with a length of four which were displayed in a grand tour.
    \end{itemize}
  }

% Dr. Michael Lawrence and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center were working on a DNA data set and needed a way to view the distribution of DNA sequence samples relative to the possible combinations. The output needed to have a feasible way to tell trends while still showing as much data as possible.
%
% The original goal was to make outputs for a sequence of 6 digits but was later reduced to 4 digits when some constraints were imposed. The project was an extension of the polytope ranking from Spring 2008. It developed proportionally sized spheres at each vertice/combination with points jittered on the surface of the sphere. This makes the most common sequences `pop' out at the viewer.

    \end{itemize}
  }

% FaceOff is a game that is designed to help calibrate your eyes into viewing and mind into thinking in the fourth dimension. In 2004, the game arose from discussions between David Bulger and Dr. Dianne Cook as a first attempt to grow a 2-D game into higher dimensions. It has been further developed by Spencer Bradley, Dr. Hadley Wickham , Dr. Heike Hofmann and myself.
%
% The goal of the game is to connect a square in a 4-D cube with all four corners painted with your color. The game is a combination of ``Connect 4'', ``Tic Tac Toe'', and ``Dots and Lines'', only it is played in 4-D.  It is similar to `Connect 4' in that you need all four dots of your color, `Dots and Lines' in that you make a square, and the strategies from `Tic Tac Toe'.

%   \item Modernize a strain gauge and monitor into a LabView program.
%   \item Strain gauge was used to determine friction on the material.
%   \item Supervised by Dr. Sriram Sundararajan.
% \end{itemize}

% The Freshman Honors program provides a wonderful opportunity for freshman undergrad students to participate in research.  I participated under Dr. Sriram Sundararajan, a Mechanical Engineer professor,  on micro/nanoscale tribology.  The goal of the project was to take the old strain gauge and strain gauge monitor and turn it into a modern-day strain gauge system.  Another program member and I learned how to use LabVIEW and then used our knowledge to program a system to interpret the readings from the strain gauge attached to the system.  The program that we made allowed the user to record the strain caused by the friction from the spinning material over time.  The program also calculated the coefficient of friction at each time.  We ran several test runs on the new system to check it.
