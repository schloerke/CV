\section{Research}

\subsection{Purdue University}

\begin{itemize}
  \item{\bf trelliscopejs:} - Spring 2015
    \begin{itemize}      
      \item Ported original trelliscope R package to be separated from shiny
      \item Full visual implementation in javascript dramatically increases interaction time
      \item Utilized Ember javascript platform to produce a single webpage application with multiple URLS
    \end{itemize}


  \item{\bf Bitcoin:} DARPA XDATA - Summer 2013
    \begin{itemize}      
      \item Brought previous transaction exporter up to protocol
      \item Formatted escrow transactions to be matched easier
      \item Made ``None'' keys uniquely identifiable, rather than being treated the same
      \item Matched some ``None'' keys to valid output keys
      \item Updated User exporter to include all information available
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Rice University VIGRE Program} Summer 2009
\begin{itemize}
  \item Performed exploratory analysis on the housing crisis
  \item Found, cleaned, and explored multiple data sets
  \item Created all outputs reproducible from scratch
  \item Supervised by Dr. Hadley Wickham
\end{itemize}

% VIGRE is a program sponsored by the National Science Foundation to carry out innovative educational programs in which research and education are integrated and in which undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty are mutually supportive.  During my stay at Rice University, I worked daily with two other undergraduate students, one graduate student, and our professor, Dr. Hadley Wickham.  
% 
% Our group project was to perform exploratory analysis on the housing crisis.  I found, cleaned, and explored multiple data sets.  The R programming language was used to clean the data.  To stay up-to-date with the other group members, Git, a repository language that evolved from SVN, was used constantly throughout the program.  One big requirement, which was followed during the project, was reproducibility.  Anyone could start  by retrieving our code and reproduce everything that we have already produced by sourcing the files we have made.  
% 
% Near the end of the internship, my undergraduate group gave a 20-minute speech on our findings, what we were currently working on, and where the group was heading in the future.  



\subsection{Novartis Pharmaceutical} Summer 2008
\begin{itemize}
  \item Created a time management tool using gantt charts to help management quickly display availability.
  \item Created a web-based tutorial consisting of examples of the most common graphics produced when using different layouts.  This allowed users to know exactly how everything was being displayed.  (white-box)
  \item Worked coherently with the top 15 statisticians within Novartis.
  \item Supervised by Dr. Anthony Rossini and Mentored by Dr. Francois Mercier.
\end{itemize}

% Modeling and Simulation group, Novartis AG. Basel, Switzerland. Invited by Anthony Rossini. Summer 2008. Development of graphical methods, tutorials for visualizing data, and a time management tool.
% 
% The web-based tutorial consisted of examples of most common graphics produced when using different layouts. It included new ways to display data as well. The time management tool produced outputs of the projects that people were involved in as reported in a .CSV file (exported .XLS file). The tool used an API to execute everything. It could allow the outputs to be split by project or similar criteria.
% 
% During the internship, I worked coherently with the top 15 statisticians within Novartis.  Each week we meet to learn about what each other was doing.


\subsection{ISU Statistics Research} Summer 2007 to Fall 2010
\begin{itemize}
  \item Supervised by Dr. Dianne Cook and Dr. Heike Hofmann
\end{itemize}
% Starting in the Summer of 2007, I worked under Dr. Dianne Cook and Dr. Heike Hofmann, ISU Statistics professors. Since then, I have explored different topics in graphics. Each project has touched on different areas. (Starting from most recent).

\begin{itemize}
  \item{\bf 2009 American Statistical Association Data Expo:} Delayed, Cancelled, On-Time, Boarding ... Flying in the USA - Spring 2009
    \begin{itemize}      
      \item Displayed airport delays caused by airport layout using multiple applications.
      \item Using Google's KML language, R and wget, we produced Google Earth images with the runways highlighted.
      \item Iowa State University working group finished 2nd in the \href{http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/posters/}{world competition}.
    \end{itemize}
    % \item{\bf 2009 ASA Data Expo:} Delayed, Cancelled, On-Time, Boarding ... Flying in the USA
    % 
    % The 2009 ASA Data Expo aim was to produce a graphical summary of important features.  Areas that I worked on dealt with which carriers were the best and why they were the best, which carriers performed the least amount of ``ghost flights'' (empty flights) and whether or not the layout of the airport was correlated with delays.  
    % 
    % Displaying the airport delays caused by airport layout used multiple applications.  Using Google's KML language, R and wget, Chris and I were able to produce Google Earth Images with the runways highlighted.  Following this, we produced images of the wind tendencies at each airport and matched them up with the corresponding airport runway direction.
    % 
    % The group finished 2nd in the \href{http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/posters/}{world competition}.
    
    

  \item{\bf Election Data:} Explore new ways to show the Electoral College for the 2008 Presidential Election - Fall 2008
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Created a custom cartogram of the United States with area proportional to the electoral vote of each state.
    \item Produced the `Electoral Vote Towers' (inspired by New York Times 2000 Presidential Race) that quickly portrayed the electoral vote status.
  \end{itemize}

  % This project focused on the electoral votes of each state. A cartogram of the United States with the area proportional to the electoral vote of each state and the `Electoral Vote Towers' were the two main graphics that I helped develop.
  % 
  % The cartogram shows voting pattern in a way that is more representative of the electoral votes while maintaining some geographic relations. The cartogram is block-constructed, coded, and imported into R. It demonstrates the states' area in proportion to its electoral votes. For example, Montana only has an area of three votes, while Rhode Island has an area of four votes even though it is much smaller geographically.  (Votes are determined by the number of representatives within the House and Senate, not by geographic area).
  % 
  % The `Electoral Vote Towers' was inspired by a New York Times display during the 2000 presidential election titled ?Building an Election Victory?. These displays show the sum of the electoral votes for each candidate. The shape comes from each state's percent difference (horizontal) and electoral votes (vertical). While the colors may be redundant, it still helps categorize the states' voting percentages. The goal of the candidates is to reach the 270 votes needed to win the presidency which corresponds to the towers building up to the 270th line. Each of the states that are still a toss-up have their relevant statistics reported on the candidate's side to which they are currently leaning.




\item{\bf DNA:} Viewing DNA sequence data - Fall 2008
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extension of the polytope ranking.
  \item Created combinations of DNA sequences with a length of four which were displayed in a grand tour.
\end{itemize}

% Dr. Michael Lawrence and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center were working on a DNA data set and needed a way to view the distribution of DNA sequence samples relative to the possible combinations. The output needed to have a feasible way to tell trends while still showing as much data as possible.
% 
% The original goal was to make outputs for a sequence of 6 digits but was later reduced to 4 digits when some constraints were imposed. The project was an extension of the polytope ranking from Spring 2008. It developed proportionally sized spheres at each vertice/combination with points jittered on the surface of the sphere. This makes the most common sequences `pop' out at the viewer.

\item{\bf Polytope Ranking:} Visualizing ranked data - Spring 2008
\begin{itemize}
  \item Created a model that would connect a ranked data set.
  \item Added jittered data points to each combination with the distance relative to the amount of points.
\end{itemize}


\item{\bf FaceOff:} `Lines and Dots' in the fourth dimension - 2007
\begin{itemize}
  \item Game created to calibrate users into viewing and thinking in the fourth dimension.
  \item Game is a combination of  ``Connect 4'', ``Tic Tac Toe'', and ``Dots and Lines.''
\end{itemize}

% FaceOff is a game that is designed to help calibrate your eyes into viewing and mind into thinking in the fourth dimension. In 2004, the game arose from discussions between David Bulger and Dr. Dianne Cook as a first attempt to grow a 2-D game into higher dimensions. It has been further developed by Spencer Bradley, Dr. Hadley Wickham , Dr. Heike Hofmann and myself. 
% 
% The goal of the game is to connect a square in a 4-D cube with all four corners painted with your color. The game is a combination of ``Connect 4'', ``Tic Tac Toe'', and ``Dots and Lines'', only it is played in 4-D.  It is similar to `Connect 4' in that you need all four dots of your color, `Dots and Lines' in that you make a square, and the strategies from `Tic Tac Toe'. 

% The FaceOff \href{http://www.public.iastate.edu/~bigbear/FaceOff/index.html}{website} has a video and PDF tutorial.


\item{\bf IEEE Infovis Competition:} 2007 Infovis visualization competition
\begin{itemize}
  \item Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) competition.
  \item Worked on the genres of the database using the ``Many Eyes'' web application.
  \item Helped edit and produce the \href{http://had.co.nz/infovis-2007/}{movie} that the working group submitted.
\end{itemize}

% The 2007 Infovis competition dealt with Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB). I contributed by doing work on the genres of IMDB's movie database through the use of Many Eyes.  The link for the movie that I helped edit is located on Dr. Hadley Wickham's \href{http://had.co.nz/infovis-2007/}{website}.

\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Honors Research}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Modernize a strain gauge and monitor into a LabView program.
%   \item Strain gauge was used to determine friction on the material.
%   \item Supervised by Dr. Sriram Sundararajan.
% \end{itemize}

% The Freshman Honors program provides a wonderful opportunity for freshman undergrad students to participate in research.  I participated under Dr. Sriram Sundararajan, a Mechanical Engineer professor,  on micro/nanoscale tribology.  The goal of the project was to take the old strain gauge and strain gauge monitor and turn it into a modern-day strain gauge system.  Another program member and I learned how to use LabVIEW and then used our knowledge to program a system to interpret the readings from the strain gauge attached to the system.  The program that we made allowed the user to record the strain caused by the friction from the spinning material over time.  The program also calculated the coefficient of friction at each time.  We ran several test runs on the new system to check it.

  % Metamarkets is a web-based platform that allows its clients, digital publishers from around the globe, to gain better understanding of trends in the billions of ads they sell daily. Metamarkets was created to provide large-scale data analytics services. The analytics range from an hourly and daily aggregation of basic information, to predictions of how many advertisement impressions should be sold. By grouping this service in one location, many companies can interface with Metamarkets without trying to produce a similar monolithic service from scratch.
  % At Metamarkets, I design the client facing servers to route secure data and a platform for the web browser for client-side interaction. Clients request their data and it is massaged into a small and usable state so the browser is able to view the data easily. Metamarkets’ servers power the data manipulation so that the client only needs a web browser. Once the web browser has a handle on the functional data, I use the latest web graphics, D3, to produce interactive visualizations. D3 (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library created to manipulate website documents based on data. Using D3, I help build our own internal tool called DVL (Dynamic Visualization Library). DVL allows the frontend team to think in terms of pipelines rather than constantly knowing every component’s state. This allows each step of the interaction process to be independent from one another, providing simpler code and smoother interactions. Using a medium that can leverage the latest technology facilitates a symbiotic relationship between the user and company.

      % Scatterplot matrices are limited to viewing multivariate data because they only allow pairwise plots of real-valued variables. We've re-designed the scatterplot matrix to handle other variable types, and implemented this in a new R package called Gally. GGally accepts common X vs. Y combinations of data types and makes an intelligent guess at the at the best type of pairwise plot to use, for example, mosaic plot, side-by-side boxplots, or scatterplot. The upper triangle, and lower triangle, contain different plot types for the same pair of variables which may be specified. Each sub plot may be retrieved, alterd, and/or completely replaced by a custom-produced display. The software is built upon Hadley Wickham's ggplot2 package, and builds on ideas contained in Jay Emersons gpairs plot in the YaleToolkit package. Future work will expand the offerings of composite types of displays.

      % With new advances in developer technologies, putting the R programming language on the iPhone became possible.  Working with Chris Kielion, we have made the application a reality.  The application allows the user to perform on-the-fly coding, produce images, download data from the Internet, restore old code files, and save current executed code.  The coding session may then be viewed on a computer using the session ID.

\section{Undergraduate Service}
\subsection{Office / Leadership Positions}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\bf Iowa State University Hip Hop Club (Dub H):} Technology Chair and Executive Committee - 2007 to 2010
\begin{itemize}
  \item Made club self sustaining
  \item Plan, execute, and review all events
  \item Produce videos and DVDs for club
\end{itemize}
% Dub H is one of the largest Iowa State University campus organizations with over 450 members. In Dub H, I have been on the executive committee as the Technology Director since Spring semester of 2008. In the Fall of 2007, I helped make the club self-sustaining in that the club now owns its own camera, camera accessories, and editing software and equipment. As technology updates, I recommend software and hardware updates that deem necessary or beneficial. In the Fall of 2009, I updated the website and currently maintain it. The \href{http://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/dubh/}{website} now offers a google calendar and RSS feed to keep the members up-to-date. It also displays our public performances hosted by YouTube. The club performs in front of over 3000+ people within the course of a year. Being on the exec (of six people) board, we prepare for the multiple events and make certain they run smoothly.

\item{\bf GRIP Mentoring:} Leader/Friend - Fall 2007 to Spring 2010
\begin{itemize}
  \item Met with and provided guidance for a middle school student in Gilbert, IA
\end{itemize}
% Great Relationships In Pairs is a mentor program within Ames Youth and Shelter Services. I have met with the same Gilbert Middle School student for the past two and a half years. Each week we get together and I provide guidance on how to solve daily social problems as well as a fun hour for his week. It has been rewarding for both of us.

\item{\bf Greek Week Check-in:} Electronic Check-in for Events Spring 2010
\begin{itemize}
  \item Managed a system with more than 2300 records for 10+ events
  \item Linked to participants ISU card
\end{itemize}
% During Greek Week, over 2300 people need to check-in to 10+ events. Using the participants' ISU ID card, they can swipe their card to sign in. This process was manually done by three people and now it can be done with one person manning a computer. The program checks for the person in the database, whether or not they have filled out a waiver, and the participation given by each pairing. Security is used to make sure that the system cannot be altered. I created this program after gaining knowledge from a previous class project.

\item{\bf Eta Kappa Nu:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Organized event to inform middle school students what a Computer Engineer does at Iowa State University - Service Chair - Spring 2010
  \item Oversaw the meetings and made certain that the events were run properly - Vice President - Spring 2009
\end{itemize}
% I helped oversee the meetings and made certain that the events were run properly.

\item{\bf FarmHouse Fraternity:} Scholarship Chair - Fall 2007 to Spring 2009.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented five new programs to strengthen GPA
  \item Moved committee chair into an executive position
\end{itemize}
% Grades have always been important to me. After being appointed scholarship chair in the fall of 2007, I implemented over five new programs to strengthen the house's individual and group GPA. In the evenings, I was available to others in assisting them with their studies. My last semester term, I proposed that FarmHouse make this duty an executive position. The ISU chapter of FarmHouse voted to accept the position of Scholarship Chair to be on the executive committee. Subsequently, as a house we reached a new all time high GPA of  3.29.

\item{\bf E-Ball Subcommittee:} Committee Member - Spring/Fall 2007
\begin{itemize}
  \item Planned dance event for 800 people
  \item Specialized in food selection
\end{itemize}
% Engineers Week is a weeklong event at Iowa State University ending with the Engineers' Ball that hosts about 800 people. I was on the committee for the Engineers' Ball. While assisting in the planning of the overall event, my main job was to be in charge of food selection and quantity on a \$7000 budget.
